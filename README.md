### [VirtuCard](https://github.com/fabalexsie/VirtuCard-Web)
I heard about a feature that allows smartphones to open links shared via nfc tags, which should be a useful alternative to qr codes on printed ads. Then I wondered if it would be possible to simulate these nfc tags on smartphones, since smartphones can do mobile payments / simulate a credit card. I did some research and found some interesting information. Firstly, it turns out that mobile payments use a different protocol to contactless credit card payments, but secondly, it is possible to write an Android app that shares a URL via NFC. I haven't heard of any apps using this kind of feature (except maybe Android Beam), but I thought it would be useful if you wanted to share some content with someone new when you don't already have their phone number. So it is perfect for sending someone your own contact details. This is how the virtual business card project "VirtuCard" was born.

Cool features:
- Android and iOS phones can receive the shared URL / contact information
- It's fast
- You don't have to remember / type your phone number
- The shared contact information can contain additional information like image, email, ...

The project consists of two parts: an Android app that simulates the NFC tag and a website that displays the virtual business card. On the website, different users can enter their contact details and choose one of the themes. The themes can also be created and edited on the website. I used a lot of new things for this project: It was my first major Kotlin project, I integrated Monaco Editor (VS Code's text editor), it was my first project using Tailwind CSS and it was the first time I used ejs (a javascript templating language).

### [Fusion2Android](https://github.com/fabalexsie/Fusion2Android)
While modelling a new table for the living room in Autodesk Fusion. I missed an easy way to see the current state in place. My Android phone is able to display AR-content, but it doesn't support the export formats of Autodesk Fusion. So I wrote a web application (also to transfer the data from the PC to the phone). In the web application you can create a project and any Autodesk Fusion export you upload there can be viewed directly on the phone by clicking on it.

### [SWUD (Simple-Web-Upload-Docker)](https://github.com/fabalexsie/simple-web-upload-docker)
Simply use it to transfer files from a mobile device without a cable or file sharing account. The host running the Docker container spins up a local web server (accessible via http and self-signed https) and provides a simple upload form where you can upload files from your mobile device on the same network. These files are placed directly into the directory where you spin up the Docker container. Very useful for transferring screenshots from test devices to my own machine.

### [Your Spotify](https://github.com/fabalexsie/your_spotify)
This cool project by [Yooooomi](https://github.com/Yooooomi) shows statistics about your Spotify listening history. I added a few more statistics, mainly about the music genre (all changes are described in the project's [README](https://github.com/fabalexsie/your_spotify/blob/master/README.md)). To do this, I had to familiarise myself with the code, and I used the same conventions as he did. This will make it easier to merge a future pull request.
